# Project: "Assessement of Underutilized Public Land for Infill Housing Operations in Windhoek, Namibia"
*Namibian University of Science and Technology, ILMI Seed Grant Project 2020*
### Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a concrete policy proposal for the realization of urban-
infill housing on currently under-utilized publically-owned land in Windhoek. In other words, if a plot of public land has nothing on it, then new housing can be built on it. But, that new housing needs to be connected to the current infrastructure, and that is easier if the area ***around*** the available land is already built up. Those are the ideal spots for housing development, and that is what we are seeking to identify.

By utilizing a dataset of building footprints across the city, we hope to identify, at-scale, land across the city that is underutilized. We define underutilized land as exhibiting two main properties:
1. Open, non-built-up, public land
2. But surrounded by otherwise built-up land

By weighing both of these criteria, we hope to identify parcels that have available space while still being comparatively efficient to integrate with existing infrastructure. 

This repository houses the code and related materials for the computational part of these efforts.
