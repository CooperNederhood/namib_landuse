# Project: "Assessement of Underutilized Public Land for Infill Housing Operations in Windhoek, Namibia"
### Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a concrete policy proposal for the realization of urban-
infill housing on currently under-utilized publically-owned land in Windhoek.

By utilizing a dataset of building footprints across the city, we hope to identify, at-scale, land across the city that is underutilized. We define underutilized land as exhibiting two main properties:
1. Open, non-built-up, public land
2. But surrounded by otherwise built-up land

By weighing both of these criteria, we hope to identify parcels that have available space while still being comparatively efficient to integrate with existing infrastructure.

This repository houses the code and related materials for these efforts. 

### Computational approach
